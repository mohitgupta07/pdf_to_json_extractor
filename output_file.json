Providing wrong or misleading information that  you  know could either help  you  gain financially, or  us  suffer a financial loss, is fraud and pushes up the cost of insurance for all customers.

We  might also refuse to pay a claim, or make  you  repay any  money we \u2019ve already paid out in claims where fraud has occurred.  We \u2019ll also tell other  insurer s and anti-fraud databases, which could affect  your  ability to get access to insurance and other financial services in the future.  We  may also let the police know, who may choose to bring charges against  you  that could ultimately result in a prosecution. So please make sure that you\u2019re always honest with us. This way  we  can pay any claims  you  make and keep the cost of  our  insurance down for all  our  customers. "

Insurance Provider   The type of personal data we share with the insurance provider is: your full name, age, date of birth, residential address, driving licence details, whether you have any claims or  convictions, policy documents, your Selfie image, vehicle images, your email address and phone number, the car owner's name and telephone number, and the results of the Verification Checks.  When you purchase insurance you are entering into a contact with the insurance provider. We share this information because we need to do so in order for you to enter into a contract for insurance and the insurance provider may use it in connection with any claim you make under your policy.  The insurance provider is a data controller of your personal data and is separately and independently responsible for its use of your personal data. You can find out more about how the Insurance Providers use your personal information by visiting their privacy policy.  Our Principal  We act as an Authorised Representative of Davies MGA Services Limited (Davies). This means that Davies, who is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to provide insurance distribution services, has appointed us to act on their behalf, which enables us to facilitate your purchase of insurance products via the App.  We will share your personal data with Davies where necessary to allow Davies to comply with legal obligations it is under (such as FCA regulations) and to deal with complaints.  Davies also provides services to us to ensure that our practices are FCA compliant. We will share personal data with Davies to the extent necessary for them to provide those services.   Davies is separately and independently responsible for its use of your personal data. You can find out more about how Davies will use your personal data in its privacy notice  here .  Complaints and claims  If you make a complaint to Davies or the insurance provider related to insurance purchased through the App, those parties may share personal information relating to that complaint with us to help resolve the complaint. Similarly if you make a complaint to us, we may share information relating to that complaint with them.  Similarly, if you make a claim under your insurance policy, the insurance provider may share information related to that claim with us.  This is in our legitimate interests to ensure complaints and claims are dealt with properly and to understand how insurance policies purchased via the App are used.  Other data sharing:  We use third party service providers in connection with the fraud and security checks and eligibility and quotation generation processes as described above.  We also use a number of other service providers to help us run our App as efficiently and effectively as possible, which is in our legitimate interests. This includes data hosting providers, customer communications providers, marketing and analytics providers, software developers and branding agencies. We disclose your personal data to them where this is necessary for them to provide those services to us. We require these third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow third-party services providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.  We may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal data. Examples of the type of situation where this would occur would be: ",

If a change of this kind happens to our business, then the new entities may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.  We may also disclose anonymised data (such as aggregated statistics) about the users of the App and the Site in order to describe sales, customers, traffic patterns and other site information to prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.  We may also need to share data with your personal data with solicitors and professional service firms who act on our or your behalf, or who represent a third-party claimant. "
