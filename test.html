Making a change to the cover under the policy  </p><p>If you want to make a change to the cover under this policy, you should tell us immediately via the Getsafe app, </p><p>or email or by phone. When you tell us about a change, we will let you know if it will affect your insurance. For </p><p>example, we may change the terms of your insurance, you may have to pay more for your insurance, or we may </p><p>cancel your insurance in line with the Cancellation section below. </p><p></p><p>4. Cancellation Rights </p><p>1. </p><p></p><p>If you decide within 14 days of first taking out this policy or of receipt of your policy documents, that the policy </p><p>does not meet your requirements, you may cancel the policy and receive a full refund of the premium you </p><p>have already paid.  </p><p></p><p>2.  After 14 days of first taking out this policy, if you cancel the policy, we will give you a pro-rata refund of the </p><p></p><p>monthly premium you have already paid for the remaining portion of the period of insurance. </p><p>If the policy is cancelled, the period of insurance ends on the cancellation date.  </p><p></p><p>3. </p><p>4.  You can cancel the policy using the Getsafe app or by contacting our Customer Service team. </p><p>5.  Cover  under  your  policy  will  not  commence  and  your  insurance  policy  will  not  be  valid  until  we  receive </p><p>payment of your first premium. If we have not received payment of your first premium on the date your policy </p><p>is due to commence, we will notify you by email that your policy is not in force because we have not received </p><p>payment and invite you to make the necessary payment. </p><p>Once cover under your policy has commenced, we can cancel the policy by giving 14 days’ notice by email. </p><p>We will only do this for a valid reason, for example if: </p><p></p><p>- </p><p></p><p>If  you  don't  pay  your  premium  when  due  after  you  have  paid  your  first  premium  or  if  you  miss  a </p><p>payment, we will notify you and give you a further date to pay.

If we cancel the policy, we will give you a pro-rata refund of the monthly premium you have already paid for </p><p>the remaining portion of the period of insurance. However, we will not refund any premium if you have made </p><p>a  claim  or  for  another  valid  reason,  including  where  you  make  a  false  claim  and/or  provide  information </p><p>recklessly or provide deliberately false information. </p><p></p><p>7.  We will not make any payment under this  policy unless you have paid the  premium. If you miss your first </p><p>payment, your policy will not be valid. If we do not receive your first payment, we will contact you by email </p><p>and invite you to make payment within 7 days from the due date. If you make payment within 7 days, we will </p><p>treat your policy as in force from the original policy start date. </p><p></p><p>8.  If you have made a claim during the policy period then you will have to pay the full premium, so you won’t </p><p></p><p>receive a refund. </p><p></p><p>5. Renewals </p><p>Your policy runs from the start date shown on your schedule for 12 months. Your policy may be automatically </p><p>renewed, and payment taken at the end of the cover date set out in your policy document unless you contact our </p><p>customer services department to opt-out of automatic renewal 2 working days before the renewal date. We will </p><p>contact you before your renewal date and before taking payment to confirm your renewal terms. </p><p></p><p>If you change your mind after your policy has been renewed, you will have a 14-day cooling off period so you can </p><p>still decide to cancel free of charge and will be refunded in case we already took payment. </p><p></p><p>You  can  opt-out  of  automatic  renewals  at  any  time  by  contacting  our  customer  service  department  without </p><p>cancelling your policy. </p><p></p><p>6. Premium payment </p><p>We will not make any payment under this policy unless you have paid the premium. </p><p></p><p>7. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act </p><p>You and the insurer (Getsafe acts as agent of the insurer) are the only parties to this policy. Nothing in this policy </p><p>is intended to give any person any right to enforce any term of this policy which that person would not have had </p><p>but for the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. </p><p></p><p>8. Deliberately false or recklessly given information </p><p>If you are found to have deliberately or recklessly given false information the insurer will treat this policy as if it </p><p>never existed and refuse all claims. You must repay any payments already made by the insurer under the policy </p><p>and no premium will be returned to you. </p><p></p><p>9. Carelessly given information </p><p>If you acted carelessly when giving us your information, several things could happen: </p><p></p><p>1. </p><p></p><p>2. </p><p></p><p>3. </p><p></p><p>if the insurer provided insurance cover that they would not otherwise have offered, the insurer will treat this </p><p>insurance as if it had never existed. If this happens, the insurer will give you back your premium and you must </p><p>repay any payments already made by them under the policy; </p><p>if the insurer would have insured you on different terms, the insurer will amend this retrospectively and apply </p><p>these amended terms to all claims under the policy, including any claims you have already made; or </p><p>if  the  insurer  would  have  provided  this  policy  but  charged  a  higher  premium,  the  insurer  may  reduce  the </p><p>amount payable for any claim or loss in the proportion that the premium you have paid bears to the premium </p><p>the insurer would have charged if you had fairly presented the risk to the insurer.

Other insurance </p><p>We  will  not  pay  any  claim  that  would  be  covered  under  any  other  insurance  policy  if  this  policy  did  not  exist. </p><p>However, if the other insurance cover has all been used up, we will pay the amount that is over the cover available </p><p>under that other insurance.

Fraud </p><p>In order to protect our customers from the cost of fraud, we work to detect and prevent fraud. </p><p>We expect you and your family, and anyone acting for you, to act honestly. </p><p></p><p>If we find that you deliberately or recklessly provided us with false or misleading information when taking out or </p><p>varying your policy, this could affect your insurance cover and any claim you make. </p><p></p><p>We may treat this policy as if it had never existed (it will become void) refuse to pay all claims, and not return the </p><p>premium you have paid. </p><p></p><p>If you make a fraudulent claim under this policy, we: </p><p></p><p>a)   do not have to pay the claim; </p><p>b)   may recover from you any amounts we have paid you in connection with the claim; and </p><p>c)   may treat the contract as having ended at the time of the fraudulent act. </p><p></p><p>We will give you notice if we plan to do any of the things listed above.  </p><p></p><p>If we use our right under clause c) above, we: </p><p></p><p>a)   will not be liable to you for any loss, damage, injury or liability which arose after the time of the fraudulent </p><p></p><p>act; and </p><p></p><p>b)   do not have to return any premiums you have paid. </p><p></p><p>If this policy provides cover for any other person besides you (a ‘covered person’), and a fraudulent claim is made </p><p>under this policy by or on behalf of a covered person, we may use our rights set out in this clause 6 as if there were </p><p>a  separate  contract  between us and  the  covered  person.  If we  decide  to  do  this, it  will  not affect  the cover  we </p><p>provide under the policy to any other person. </p><p></p><p>We  have  the  right  to  recover  from  you  or  your  family  our  and  our  representatives’  costs  in  investigating  any </p><p>fraudulent  claim.  If  this  insurance  becomes  void  because  of  fraud  or  we  suspect  that  a  crime  may  have  been </p><p>committed in respect of this policy, we have the right to tell the police or other relevant authority and to cancel </p><p>any other insurance policies that you have with us. </p><p></p><p>12. Law that applies </p><p>Unless some other law is agreed in writing, this policy will be governed by the laws of England. If there is a dispute, </p><p>it will only be dealt with in the courts of England or of the country within the United Kingdom in which your home </p><p>is situated. </p><p></p><p>13. Reasonable care and preventing loss </p><p>Please note that: </p><p></p><p>1.  You must take all necessary and reasonable steps to prevent or limit accident, injury, loss or damage to </p><p></p><p>your buildings and contents or liability to others. </p><p></p><p>2.  You must make sure that your buildings are maintained in a good state of repair. </p><p>3.  You must keep the contents covered by this policy in good condition. </p><p>4. </p><p></p><p>If any security measures are installed to protect the buildings (for example, window locks), you must use </p><p>these whenever the buildings are left unattended, as well as when everyone in the home has gone to </p><p>bed for the night. </p><p></p><p>If you make a claim under this policy and we decide that the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense that led to the </p><p>claim was caused or made worse by you failing to meet your obligations under this clause, we may refuse to pay </p><p>the claim or we may reduce the amount of any payment we make for the claim, pay only part of the claim or we </p><p>may cancel your policy. </p><p></p><p>14. Using your property for business purposes </p><p>The property must not be used to carry out any business activities other than office administration work on behalf </p><p>of your business or the business of your employer. </p><p></p><p>You  must  not  carry  out  any  form  of  manufacturing,  packaging  of  goods  or  manual  work,  including  using </p><p>machinery or tools, in your property (including in any outbuildings or garages which are part of or attached to </p><p>the main building). </p><p></p><p>You must not have visitors entering your property for the purpose of carrying out business, and you must not </p><p>have any employees working at your property for the purpose of carrying out business.

You must comply with the </p><p>obligations set out in the following claims conditions. If the insurer determines that any </p><p>claim you make under this policy has been adversely impacted directly by your failure to </p><p>comply with any of the following claim’s conditions, the insurer may refuse or withdraw </p><p>from the claim or reduce the amount of any payment they make for the claim. </p><p></p><p>Please note, we work with our claims administrator who handles claims on behalf of us and the insurer. If you </p><p>have any queries regarding the role of the claims administrator, please let us know. </p><p></p><p>Making a claim </p><p>You must give us notice, as soon as reasonably possible, of anything which is likely to give rise to a claim under this </p><p>policy.  </p><p></p><p>For Home Emergency:  </p><p>If  you  require emergency  assistance  you can speak to the 24-hour emergency  assistance team on 0190  830 </p><p>2031.  </p><p></p><p>For Regular Claims: </p><p>You can make a claim with your Getsafe app in the claims section.

Try to get lost items back by calling lost property services.  </p><p>3. </p><p></p><p>In case you are making a claim with regards to a specified valuable, please have a picture of the said item ready </p><p>prior to making a claim. </p><p></p><p>4.  Do not throw damaged items away – until our insurer approves that it is OK to do so.  </p><p>5.  Do not repair or replace items without our insurer agreeing to it first – unless it’s an emergency.  </p><p></p><p>Claim Conditions </p><p>1. </p><p></p><p>In the event of a call to the Getsafe customer service team, you will need to provide your full name and contact </p><p>details, your address and postcode, the policy number and circumstances of the claim. </p><p></p><p>2.  You must: </p><p></p><p>a)  within 28 days of notifying us of a claim or anything likely to give rise to a claim, give the insurer, at your </p><p>expense, any information, including proof of ownership, which they may reasonably require and co-operate </p><p>fully in the investigation of any claim under this policy, </p><p></p><p>b)  report to the police or relevant local authority, as soon as reasonably possible, any loss or damage arising </p><p>from theft, fire caused by arson, vandalism, riot or civil disturbance and obtain a crime reference from them, </p><p></p><p>c)  give the insurer reasonable evidence of the value of all items involved in a claim, and </p><p>d)  be able to demonstrate to the insurer that you have complied in full with the terms and conditions of this </p><p></p><p>policy and that the cause of the loss or damage which is the subject of the claim is not excluded. </p><p></p><p>3.  You  must  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  minimise  any  loss  or  damage  and  take  appropriate  measures </p><p></p><p>immediately if they are required to reduce any claim. </p><p></p><p>Please note that a withdrawn claim will still count as if a claim has been handed in, and therefore is counted against </p><p>the claim limits within some sections of this policy.  </p><p></p><p>When we receive a claim </p><p>When we receive a claim, we will do the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  Enter any buildings following loss or damage. We will always arrange this with you beforehand. </p><p>2.  Carry  out  any  work  that  is  needed  to  reduce  any  further  loss  or  damage  and  secure  the  site  to  prevent </p><p></p><p>unauthorised entry, especially if the site may be a risk to health and safety. </p><p></p><p>3.  Negotiate, defend or settle any claim made against you. </p><p>4.  Prosecute  or  start  court  proceedings  against  any  other  person  or  business  in  your  name  for  our  benefit  in </p><p></p><p>respect of any claim we may have to pay. </p><p></p><p>5.  Arrange the rebuilding work, repairs or replacements, and dispose of any damaged items appropriately. We </p><p></p><p>have the right to choose which contractors to instruct to carry out the work. </p><p></p><p> 14 | 44 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getsafe Home Insurance </p><p></p><p>Payment of excess </p><p>If you need to claim on more than one part of your buildings or contents policy for the same event, we’ll only </p><p>make  you  pay  one  excess.  This  will  be  the  highest  excess  that  applies  to  the  parts  of  your  policy  that  you’re </p><p>claiming under. </p><p></p><p>Recovering a loss payment </p><p>The insurer may start proceedings in your name to recover, for the insurer’s benefit, the amount of any payment </p><p>they have made under this policy. You must give the insurer all the assistance they may reasonably require to do </p><p>this. </p><p></p><p>False claims </p><p>If the insurer determines that any claim you make under this policy has been adversely impacted directly by your </p><p>failure to comply with any of the above claim’s conditions, the insurer may refuse or withdraw from the claim or </p><p>reduce the amount of any payment they make for the claim.  </p><p></p><p>Additionally, please note that if your claim is in any way dishonest, exaggerated or fraudulent then the insurer will: </p><p></p><p>tell you that they are terminating your policy and back date the termination to the date of the fraud; </p><p></p><p>1. </p><p>2.  refuse to make any payment under this policy in respect of any claim made or any loss occurring on or after </p><p></p><p>the date of the fraud; and </p><p>3.  not return any premium. </p><p>4.

If you’ve not taken out enough </p><p>cover to replace your property and possessions as new, this may have an effect on how much we pay for a claim. </p><p>To  work  out  the  value  of  your  contents,  make a  list  of all  your  belongings  and  calculate  what  it  would cost  to </p><p>replace them as new. </p><p></p><p>If you make a claim and we discover that you didn’t have enough cover, there are a number of different ways that </p><p>we can handle your case. If our team decides that we wouldn’t have offered you insurance if you’d given us more </p><p>accurate information when you bought your policy, we won’t be able to pay any of your claim. </p><p></p><p>The insurer will pay up to the amount insured stated in the schedule unless limited below: </p><p></p><p>Repair and replacement </p><p>At the insurer’s option, the insurer will repair, replace or pay for any lost or damaged items </p><p>on the following basis: </p><p></p><p>1. </p><p></p><p>for personal possessions other than clothing and footwear, property hired-in by you, goods held in trust and </p><p>art and collections, the cost of repair or replacement as new. </p><p></p><p>2.  for clothing and footwear, the cost of repair or replacement considering wear and tear based on the following </p><p></p><p>less than three years old, the cost of repair or replacement as new, </p><p></p><p>scale: </p><p>a) </p><p>b)  between three and five years old, a 30% reduction for wear and tear, and </p><p>c)  between five and seven years old, a 60% reduction for wear and tear. </p><p></p><p>3.  the insurer will not make any payment for any clothing or footwear that is more than seven years old. </p><p>4.  for property hired-in by you, the lesser of: </p><p></p><p>a)  the extent of your legal liability in respect of repairing or replacing the hired-in property as specified in the </p><p></p><p>hire contract, the costs of repair of the hired-in property, and </p><p></p><p>b)  the  costs  of  replacement  of  the  hired-in  property  with  a  model  of  equivalent  specification,  age  and </p><p></p><p>condition. </p><p></p><p>5.  for goods held in trust, the lesser of: </p><p></p><p>a)  your liability in respect of the goods held in trust, and </p><p>b)  the cost of repair or replacement at the trade market value of such goods. </p><p></p><p>6.  for art and collections: </p><p></p><p>a)  the agreed value of any lost or damaged item which is individually valued in the schedule or contained in </p><p>any valuation lodged with us. However, if the item is only partly damaged, the insurer will decide whether </p><p>to repair, restore, replace or pay the agreed value of the damaged item. If the insurer repairs or restores a </p><p>damaged item, they will also pay for any loss in value, </p><p></p><p>b)  where any item that has not been individually valued in the schedule or valuation, the insurer will decide </p><p>whether to repair, restore, replace or make a cash settlement for that item. If the insurer chooses to make </p><p>a cash settlement, they will pay the market value of the item immediately prior to the damage. </p><p></p><p>Settling liability claims </p><p>In dealing with a liability claim under the terms of this policy, either before or after we pay your claim, </p><p>we may do the following. </p><p></p><p>a)  Defend or settle any claim and choose the solicitor who will represent us and you in any legal action. If we </p><p></p><p>do this, we will pay any fees involved. </p><p></p><p>b)  Take any legal action in your name or in the name of any other person covered by this policy. Once legal </p><p></p><p>action has started, we will have complete control of the matter. </p><p></p><p>Pairs and sets </p><p>1.  We treat each separate item of a matching pair, set or suite of furniture, soft furnishings, bathroom suite or </p><p>other fixtures and fittings as a single item. If an item that’s part of a matching set or suite is damaged, we’ll aim </p><p>to  repair  it  or  provide  an  identical  replacement.  However,  if  it’s  not  possible  to  provide  a  suitable  repair  or </p><p>replacement,  we’ll  only  pay  for  the  damaged  item.  Just  to  be  clear,  we’ll  not  make  any  contribution  for </p><p>undamaged items that are part of a set or suite. If an item in a matching set or suite is lost or damaged, the </p><p>undamaged matching items may lose some value even if they haven’t been lost or damaged themselves. This </p><p>loss of value is not covered by your policy. </p><p>If you’ve got a matching carpet or other floor covering in more than one room or area of your home, and this </p><p>is separated by a break, then we’ll treat each room or area as separate. By break we mean something that was </p><p>originally designed to separate a room, for instance carpet dividing floor strips, doorways, archways and where </p><p>the remains of previous partitions are still intruding the room. We’ll only pay for the damage to the carpet or </p><p>floor covering in the room or area where the damage happened, and we won’t pay for matching carpets in </p><p>other rooms. </p><p></p><p>2. </p><p></p><p> 16 | 44 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getsafe Home Insurance </p><p></p><p>3.  We  treat  pairs  or  sets  of  anything  apart  from  bathroom,  kitchen  and  furniture  suites,  as  one  item.  So,  for </p><p>example,  if  your  bag  of  golf  clubs  was  stolen,  we’d  treat  these  as  one  item,  and  would  only  pay  up  to  the </p><p>maximum claim limit for a single item to replace the entire set. Similarly, if you lost a pair of earrings, we’d treat </p><p>the pair as one single item. </p><p></p><p>Removing debris </p><p>Under the buildings section we will also pay to remove debris following an insured claim.  </p><p></p><p>Maintenance </p><p>A  well-maintained  building  should  withstand  all  but  the  most  severe  weather  conditions.  It  is  important  to </p><p>remember that you are responsible for maintaining your home in a good state of repair. If the buildings have not </p><p>been maintained in a good state of repair, when assessing a claim, we will take into account the condition of your </p><p>property and we may refuse to pay the claim or we may reduce the amount of any payment we make for the </p><p>claim.  </p><p></p><p>We  will  not  cover  the  costs  of  repairs  or  replacements,  where  the  costs  arise  through  you  failing  to  regularly </p><p>maintain the buildings properly.  </p><p></p><p>Other interests </p><p>Any  payment  will  consider  the  interest  of  any  party  having  an  insurable  interest  in  the  personal  possessions, </p><p>provided you have advised the insurer of the nature and extent of the interest together with the name and address </p><p>of that interested party. </p><p></p><p>Special limits </p><p></p><p>1.  Single article limit </p><p></p><p>The most the insurer will pay for any item, pair or set, other than cycles, which is not individually specified in </p><p>the schedule, is the single article limit amount shown in the schedule. </p><p></p><p>2.  Specified items away from your home </p><p></p><p>If the amount insured for  personal  possessions while away from  your  home shown in the schedule is less </p><p>than  the  amount  for  a  specified  item  shown  in  the  schedule,  the  most  the  insurer  will  pay  in  total  for  all </p><p>specified items while away from your home is the amount insured for personal possessions while away from </p><p>your home. </p><p></p><p>You must take care to ensure that you have purchased sufficient cover for specified items while away from </p><p>your home. </p><p></p><p>3.  Cycles </p><p></p><p>The most the insurer will pay for damage to any cycle is the amount shown in the schedule. </p><p></p><p>Always tell the truth </p><p>It’s really important that you’re honest with us when you’re buying a policy or making a claim. This applies to your </p><p>Buildings and/or Contents, and optional or enhanced covers. Providing wrong or misleading information that you </p><p>know could either help you gain financially, or us suffer a financial loss, is fraud and pushes up the cost of insurance </p><p>for all customers. If you’ve given us inaccurate information we may void the policy, which means we’d treat you </p><p>as though the policy had never been issued, and we wouldn’t give you a refund. </p><p></p><p>We might also refuse to pay a claim, or make you repay any money we’ve already paid out in claims where fraud </p><p>has occurred. We’ll also tell other insurers and anti-fraud databases, which could affect your ability to get access </p><p>to insurance and other financial services in the future. We may also let the police know, who may choose to bring </p><p>charges against you that could ultimately result in a prosecution. So please make sure that you’re always honest </p><p>with us. This way we can pay any claims you make and keep the cost of our insurance down for all our customers. </p><p></p><p> 17 | 44 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getsafe Home Insurance </p><p></p><h2>SECTION 6 – GENERAL EXCLUSIONS </h2><p></p><p>The following exclusions apply to all sections of this policy. </p><p></p><p>Any additional exclusions are shown in the sections they apply to. </p><p></p><p>We don’t cover the following. </p><p></p><p>1.
